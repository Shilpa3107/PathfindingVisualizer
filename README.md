**Pathfinding Visualizer**

**Overview**

The Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web application that demonstrates how pathfinding algorithms work. It allows users to visualize algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) as they explore a grid to find the shortest path between a start and an end point, while avoiding obstacles.

**Features**

Visualize pathfinding algorithms step by step.
Set a Start Node, End Node, and add Obstacles on the grid.
Supports:
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Reset the grid to start fresh.

**Technologies Used**

HTML: For structuring the application.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: For implementing the logic and interactivity.

**How to Run the Project**

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PathfindingVisualizer.git
2. Open the Project
Navigate to the project folder and open index.html in your browser.
3. Use the Application
Set the Start Node (green) by clicking on any cell.
Set the End Node (red) by clicking on another cell.
Add Obstacles (black cells) by clicking on additional cells.
Click "Visualize BFS" to watch the algorithm in action.
Use "Reset Grid" to clear the grid and start again.

**How It Works**

Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Unweighted: Finds the shortest path by exploring all neighbors of a node before moving further.
Works well for grids with uniform movement costs.

**Possible Extensions**

Add more algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm, A*, or Depth-First Search (DFS).
Include weighted grids with costs for traversal.
Add animations for smoother visualization.
Make the grid size customizable.
